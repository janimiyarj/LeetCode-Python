# Python LeetCode Practice

Welcome to the Python LeetCode Practice repository! 🚀

This repository contains my Python solutions for various LeetCode problems. The goal is to practice, improve, and master problem-solving skills using Python while covering a wide range of data structures, algorithms, and coding patterns.

## 🛠️ Repository Structure

The repository is organized into directories based on problem categories and difficulty levels:

.
├── Arrays
├── Strings
├── LinkedLists
├── Trees
├── Graphs
├── DynamicProgramming
├── Backtracking
├── SortingAndSearching
├── BitManipulation
├── Math
└── README.md

Each problem file follows a consistent naming convention:

problem_name.py: Python implementation of the solution.

problem_name.md: Explanation of the solution, including approach, time complexity, space complexity, and sample test cases.

## 📋 Problem-Solving Approach

Understand the Problem: Analyze the problem statement thoroughly.

Ask Clarifying Questions: Identify any edge cases or constraints.

Brute Force Approach: Explore the simplest solution and analyze its complexity.

Optimized Solution: Identify patterns, apply efficient algorithms, and optimize the solution.

Code Implementation: Write clean, modular, and well-commented Python code.

Testing: Run the code with sample test cases to verify correctness and performance.

## 🧠 Concepts Covered

Data Structures: Arrays, Strings, Linked Lists, Stacks, Queues, Trees, Graphs, Heaps, Hash Maps.

Algorithms: Sorting, Searching, Divide & Conquer, Recursion, Dynamic Programming, Backtracking, Greedy Algorithms.

Advanced Topics: Bit Manipulation, Sliding Window, Two Pointers, Union-Find, Trie.

## ⚙️ Setup Instructions
